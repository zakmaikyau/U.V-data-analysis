# First, we'll need to import some libraries that we'll use for the analysis

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Next, we'll read in the UV data from a CSV file

uv_data = pd.read_csv("uv_data.csv")

# Now we can start analyzing the data. Let's start by plotting the UV index over time

plt.plot(uv_data["date"], uv_data["uv_index"])
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("UV Index")
plt.title("UV Index over Time")
plt.show()

# We can also calculate the average UV index for the entire dataset

avg_uv_index = uv_data["uv_index"].mean()
print("Average UV Index:", avg_uv_index)

# We can also use the pandas library to group the data by location and calculate the average UV index for each location

grouped_uv_data = uv_data.groupby("location")
location_avg_uv_index = grouped_uv_data["uv_index"].mean()
print(location_avg_uv_index)

# There are many other things we could do with the data, such as analyzing the relationship between UV index and other variables (e.g. temperature, humidity, etc.), or creating more complex visualizations.
